Welcome! I am an ecologist currently pursuing a PhD in the University of Maryland's Department of Entomology in the <a href = 'https://www.grunerlab.org/'>Gruner Lab</a>. I am conducting my research in collaboration with the Smithsonian's Virginia Working Landscapes, focused on the pest control services provided by cavity-nesting birds on working lands in Virginia.

Before my PhD, I earned a master's degree from Cal Poly Humboldt's Wildlife Department in <a href = 'https://wildlife.humboldt.edu/people/matthew-johnson'>Matt Johnson's lab</a>. I am originally from New York and earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell University. When I am not doing research, I am often spending time with my dogs, climbing, or gardening.
