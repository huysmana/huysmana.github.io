Both in and outside of agroecosystems, I have conducted research on the movement ecology of migratory and non-migratory bird species. As part of large collaboration, I co-authored the Atlas of Migratory Connectivity for the Bird of North America, soon to be published by Princeton University Press. My contributions included compiling banding and tracking data from over 500 species of migratory birds to map and model for individual species accounts. My masterâ€™s research at Cal Poly Humboldt involved barn owl nest box monitoring and GPS tracking to determine the resilience of their nesting and foraging behaviors to landscape changes from wildfires.

I published the results of these analyses in Ornithological Applications, Ecosphere, and Ecology and Evolution. In my doctoral research at the University of Maryland, I am combining diet analyses from DNA metabarcoding with GPS tracking data from cavity-nesting birds. My research will reveal how the movements of eastern bluebirds and tree swallows affect their diets and potential to provide pest control services.
